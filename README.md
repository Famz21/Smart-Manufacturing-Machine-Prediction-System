# Smart Manufacturing Machine Prediction System

The Smart Manufacturing Machine Prediction System is designed to leverage machine learning techniques for predictive maintenance in manufacturing environments. By analyzing operational data, this system aims to forecast potential machine failures, optimize maintenance schedules, and enhance overall production efficiency.

## Features

- **Predictive Maintenance**: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to anticipate equipment failures, thereby minimizing unplanned downtime and reducing maintenance costs.

- **Data-Driven Insights**: Collects and analyzes data from various machines to provide actionable insights for process optimization.

- **Integration with Existing Systems**: Designed to seamlessly integrate with current manufacturing processes and equipment.

## Installation

To set up the system locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Famz21/Smart-Manufacturing-Machine-Prediction-System.git
   ```


2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd Smart-Manufacturing-Machine-Prediction-System
   ```


3. **Install Dependencies**:
